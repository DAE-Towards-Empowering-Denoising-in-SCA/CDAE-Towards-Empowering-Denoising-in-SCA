# CDAE-Towards-Empowering-Denoising-in-SCA


This repository contains codes and data from the paper entitled "CDAE: Towards Empowering Denoising in Side-Channel Analysis".

## Discriptions

The following jupyter notebooks record the experiment details completely:

* `cdae_aes_gpu.ipynb` : records experiment on AES_GPU, the dataset is in [AES_GPU](https://github.com/DAE-Towards-Empowering-Denoising-in-SCA/AES_GPU),

* `cdae_dpav2.ipynb` : records experiment on DPAv2, the dataset can be generated by `DPAv2_generate.ipynb`,

* `cdae_ascad.ipynb` : records experiment on ASCAD, you may download the dataset yourself.


The following python scripts are neccessary for running the notebooks:

* `TemplateAttacks.py`: a Template Attacks class for profiling and attack,

* `Evaluation.py`: computes Guessing Entropy and Success Rate,

* `PoiSelection.py`: select POI for Template Attacks,

* `utlis.py`: some useful gadgets.


The folders contain the figures, results, traces and neural network weights:

* `fig`: all figures in the paper

* `Traces`: raw traces and denoised traces,

## Datasets

All datasets are obtained from publicity databases:

* `AES_GPU`: https://github.com/DAE-Towards-Empowering-Denoising-in-SCA/AES_GPU

* `DPAv2`: http://www.dpacontest.org/v2/download.php
